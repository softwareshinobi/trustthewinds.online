Remotest and nicest IN SANTA MARTA will be the beaches south of the airport at Don Jaca. Not bad in Playa Dormida either south of the Marriott Resort.

There’s also an area in Cabo Tortuga, north of Pozos Colorados that is about 2 kilometers long of abandoned beach and nice water.

The beaches of Parque Tayrona are gorgeous but usually crowded.

The north coast beaches from Playa Los Angeles to Palomino are nice and less crowded but farther out of town.

Go down to the beach just south of the Marriott. Walk south along the beach past the airport into Don Jaca. It’s a beautiful walk and pretty lonely. Except just before the airport where there are small thatched roof restaurants for about a kilometer.
