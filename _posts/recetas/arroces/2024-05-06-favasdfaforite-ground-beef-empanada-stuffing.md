Absolutely! Here's a recipe for a simple 2:1 rice dish with toasted garlic and cumin:

**Simple Toasted Rice with Garlic and Cumin**

This recipe yields approximately 2-3 servings.

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup (185g) long-grain white rice
* 2 cups (475ml) water
* 1 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil
* 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* ½ teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper (optional)

**Instructions:**

1. **Heat the oil:** In a medium saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.

2. **Toast the rice:** Add the rice to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 2-3 minutes. The rice should become slightly translucent and fragrant.

3. **Add garlic and cumin:** Add the sliced garlic and cumin to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until the garlic becomes fragrant.

4. **Season and cook:** Pour in the water, salt, and black pepper (if using). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover the pan slightly (leaving a small gap for steam to escape), and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked through and all the water has been absorbed.

5. **Fluff and serve:** Remove the pan from the heat and let the rice sit for 5 minutes with the lid on. This allows the rice to steam and become even fluffier. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.

**Tips:**

* Rinsing the rice before cooking can remove excess starch, resulting in a less sticky rice. However, rinsing is not necessary for this recipe as toasting helps prevent mushiness.
* For a richer flavor, substitute butter or ghee for the olive oil.
* Feel free to adjust the amount of garlic and cumin to your preference.
* You can add other aromatics like chopped onion or chopped fresh herbs like cilantro or parsley for an extra flavor boost. 

This simple rice recipe is a great base for many dishes. You can enjoy it plain or serve it with grilled chicken, fish, vegetables, or your favorite protein and side dish.
