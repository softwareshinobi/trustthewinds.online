here's a one-pot dump-and-go recipe for a flavorful 2:1 rice dish packed with possibilities:

**One-Pot Herbed Rice with Optional Add-Ins**

This recipe yields approximately 3-4 servings.  The beauty is in its flexibility - feel free to adjust the ingredients based on your preferences and what you have on hand!

**Base Ingredients:**

* 1 cup (185g) long-grain white rice
* 2 cups (475ml) water or broth (chicken, vegetable, or beef)
* ½ teaspoon salt
* ¼ teaspoon black pepper

**Optional Add-Ins (pick and choose as many as you like!):**

* Aromatics: 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1 chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, minced
* Vegetables: 1 cup chopped frozen mixed vegetables, ½ cup chopped fresh green peas, 1 diced red bell pepper
* Herbs: 1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 1 sprig fresh rosemary
* Spices: ½ teaspoon ground cumin, ½ teaspoon turmeric, ¼ teaspoon paprika
* Other: 1 crumbled bouillon cube, a pinch of saffron threads (for a luxurious touch)

**Instructions:**

1. **Combine everything:** In a medium saucepan, add the rice, water or broth, salt, pepper, and all your chosen add-ins (aromatics, vegetables, herbs, spices, and other).

2. **Bring to a boil:** Heat the pot over medium heat and bring everything to a boil.

3. **Reduce heat, cover, and simmer:** Once boiling, reduce heat to low, cover the pot tightly with a lid, and simmer for 15 minutes without peeking.

4. **Let it steam:** After 15 minutes, turn off the heat and let the pot sit undisturbed for another 15 minutes. This allows the rice to steam and absorb all the flavors.

5. **Fluff and serve:** Fluff the rice with a fork before serving. Enjoy!

**Tips:**

* Rinsing the rice before cooking is optional for this recipe, but can help prevent mushiness.
* Using broth instead of water adds extra flavor to the rice.
* For a richer taste, substitute butter or ghee for the olive oil. 
* Experiment with different combinations of add-ins to create your own unique rice dish. 
* Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
