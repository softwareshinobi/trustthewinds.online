step 0. go directly the MIDDLE of the park. do not stop. from the front game to the center field.

step 1. take your shirt off. i mean you too fat boy. i especially mean YOU fat boy. do it.

step 2. 10 pushups fatass. those 10 are for the top G. Andrew Tate. put some respect on the game and do some pushups.

step 3. 8 pushups. that's for me. 

step 4. start the stretch routine

for the majority of my life. i've been in an on again / off again situation with basketball.

i didnt have game. in basketball. i just played. or just played more.

but never really was playing to win.

i have adopted a number of things from james harden. just by living in houston and him being left handed like me (i stole his double tap crossover and took a dude anklees to the upper room).

eventually i actually intentionally tried to play like james harden. the article is on my blog.

## but im' changning the game

this is my swapping a new game is. shoutout drake.

from now on. i'm only going to adopt the game of playoff steph in the seasons in which he won the champtionship.

nothing of the regular season. nothing of didn't win the big one.

## why

they play different. i dont think in the regular season the 'idea' is the win every day.

the energy is different. the moves you make. the aggression boundaries. the shot selection.

different on a tuesday night snoozer on NBA tv. vs game seven elimination game.

the energy is diff.

i'm going to train to play basketball like curry does with all his flash and then use that on the courts. when winning was all that mattered. 

the version of steph curry that was playing to win a ring.

i have one in football. now i want the basketball one.

##

i must have flash in my game, no exceptions. a win is not enough for me.

this is the beginning.

in the beginning there was a 6' 4" left handed dude that swagger jacked kobe bryant who swagger jacked micheal jordan so that he could swagger jack championship steph curry and championship steph curry only. and style on every challenger for ever and ever. amen. b/c i want to win only if i style on you while i do it.
