the fight bag of mateo montenegro. the baddest bad boy on the planet.

## the mindset

first blood belongs to me.

american dominance from day one.

emulate the greats and escalate force.

humiliate and demoralize the opponent.

## philosophy

if you needed one, have two.

american aggression on full display.

we are ok being the villian. 

we are ok with an aggressive and controversial international policy.

outright aggression always beats passive aggression.

set the tone early. hit early. hit often.

have a nuke or two. make the sure the button works.
