Look, I’m talking about taking control. You gotta be the alpha in the bedroom, not just in the boardroom. It’s about dominance, it’s about performance.

First off, consistency is key. You gotta be steady, smooth, in control. No jerky movements, no sudden stops. It's about rhythm, about flow. You gotta be a metronome, man. 

Secondly, focus. It ain't about you, it's about her. You gotta be tuned in, focused on her pleasure. It's about giving, about service. That's how you build an empire in the bedroom. 

Third, keep it simple. Don't overcomplicate things. The basics done right are better than a hundred fancy moves. It's about quality, not quantity.

Finally, understand the energy exchange. Sex is a dance, a back and forth. You gotta read your partner, respond to her cues. It's about connection, about intimacy.

Remember, this ain’t about ego, it’s about domination. Dominate the bedroom, dominate her mind. That’s how you build a real empire.
